# note-taker

## Description
Created three files index.js, notes.js and server.js.

Index.js:
required all the necessary files to run node and pull information from.

Server.js:
Used app.use, get and listen to pull information from files in the public folder.

Notes.js:
In notes.js I implemented get, post and deleted functions to get data from certain files and to put data on to my localhost to be sure it runs correctly.
